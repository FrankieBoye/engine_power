## Configurable Options

#### Select the number of cylinders

Select from 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 or 12 cylinders. It is not the case that more cylinders automatically equates to more power!

#### Capacity

The capacity that can be chosen varies depending on the cylinder count. There is no such thing as a 5 litre 4 cylinder engine or a 12 cylinder 1 litre engine for example.

4 and 5 cylinder engines can range from 1 litre to 2.5 litres.

6 cylinder engines can range from 2.5 litres to 4 litres.

8 cylinder engines can range from 4 litres to 8 litres.

10 cylinder engines can range from 5 litres to 8 litres.

12 cylinder engines can range from 5 litres to 7 litres.
